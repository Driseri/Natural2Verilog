// This is a signed adder that adds two 8-bit 2's complement numbers. It also captures a signed overflow.
module signed_adder(input [7:0] a, input [7:0] b, output [7:0] s, output overflow ); 
// The numbers a and b are added to the output s. 
// The signed overflow of a and b is assigned to the output overflow.

// The adder is implemented using a 8-bit ripple carry adder.
// The carry-in is the signed overflow of the previous addition.
// The carry-out is the signed overflow of the current addition.

// The signed overflow is calculated by comparing the carry-out with the sign of the sum.
// If the carry-out is 1 and the sum is negative, then there is a signed overflow.

// The sign of the sum is calculated by comparing the sum with 0.
// If the sum is negative, then the sign is 1.
// If the sum is positive, then the sign is 0.

// The sign of the sum is calculated by comparing the sum with 0.
// If the sum is negative, then the sign is 1.
// If the sum is positive, then the sign is 0.

// The carry-in is the signed overflow of the previous addition.
// The carry-out is the signed overflow of the current addition.

// The signed overflow is calculated by comparing the carry-out with the sign of the sum.
