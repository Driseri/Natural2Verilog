// If cur_state is IDLE and a and b are both high, state changes to SAB
// If cur_state is IDLE, and a is high, state changes to SA
// If cur_state is IDLE, and b is high, state changes to SB

// If cur_state is SAB, state changes to IDLE
// Implements an FSM in Verilog
// The FSM has two states, A and B, one input, x, and one output, z.
// The output z is high only in state B. The FSM transitions from state A to state B if the input x is high. The FSM transitions from state B to state A if the input x is low.
// The FSM is reset to state A if reset is high. Otherwise, it takes value of next_state.
// The FSM has a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset.
// The FSM has a positive edge triggered synchronous clock.
// The FSM has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset.
// The FSM has a negative edge triggered synchronous clock.
// The FSM has a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset and a negative edge triggered synchronous clock.
// The FSM has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset and a positive edge triggered synchronous clock.
// The FSM has a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset, a negative edge triggered synchronous clock, and a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset.
// The FSM has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset, a positive edge triggered synchronous clock, and a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset.
// The FSM has a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset, a negative edge triggered synchronous clock, and a positive edge triggered asynchronous reset.
// The FSM has a negative edge triggered asynchronous reset
