// This is a signed adder that adds two 8-bit 2's complement numbers. It also captures a signed overflow.
module signed_adder(input [7:0] a, input [7:0] b, output [7:0] s, output overflow ); 
// The numbers a and b are added to the output s. 
// The signed overflow of a and b is assigned to the output overflow. 
// The numbers are added using a full adder. 
// A full adder is a circuit that adds two binary numbers. 
// A full adder has three inputs, A, B, and C, and three outputs, S, C, and V. 
// A is the most significant bit of the first binary number. 
// B is the most significant bit of the second binary number. 
// C is the carry-in bit. 
// S is the most significant bit of the sum. 
// C is the carry-out bit. 
// V is the overflow bit.
